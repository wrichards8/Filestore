Filestore
=========

This was my little project to create a file listing script. It simply lists files held in a folder. Installation is simple. All you need to do to use the script is to upload all the included files to a web server running PHP and put files in the "store" folder. You will need to replace the spaces in the filenames with underscores in order to download files using this script. The script use the ID3 functionality is provided by http://www.getid3.org/. I am not 100% sure what PHP version you need but I would suggest having the latest to be sure it all works
