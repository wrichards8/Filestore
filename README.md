Filestore
=========

This was my little project to create a file listing script. It simply lists files held in a folder. Installation is simple. All you need to do to use the script is to upload the index.php and main.css files to a web server running PHP and put files in the "store" folder. The ID3 functionality is provided by http://www.getid3.org/ and may not work for everyone. I am not 100% sure what PHP version you need but I would suggest having the latest to be sure it all works.
